# Contributing

You'd like to help make UnityQuery even more awesome? Seems like today's our lucky day! In order to maintain stability of the tool and its code base, please adhere to the following steps, and we'll be pleased to include your additions in our next release.

Note that UnityQuery is distributed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/npruehs/unity-query/blob/master/LICENSE). So will be your code.

## Step 1: Choose what to do

If you've got no idea how to help, head over to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/npruehs/unity-query/issues) and see what you'd like to do most. You can basically pick anything you want to, as long as it's not already assigned to anyone.

If you know exactly what you're missing, [open a new issue](https://github.com/npruehs/unity-query/issues/new) to begin a short discussion about your idea and how it fits the project. If we all agree, you're good to go!

Note there's also an [FAQ](https://github.com/npruehs/unity-query/blob/master/FAQ.md) explaining some features we deliberately did not implement in UnityQuery.

## Step 2: Fork the project and check out the code

UnityQuery is developed using the [GitFlow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In order to contribute, you should check out the latest develop branch, and create a new feature or hotfix branch to be merged back.

## Step 3: Implement your feature or bugfix

We recommend using [StyleCop](http://stylecop.codeplex.com/) for verifying your code against our [coding guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx).

## Step 4: Open a pull request

Finally, [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) so we can review your changes together, and finally integrate it into the next release.
